# Web-Audio-Keyboard

Here is a synth I wrote using Web Audio API. 
Use the keyboard to make sound. 
Z-M is the first row of white keys and S-J represents the corresponding black keys. 
Q-U is the second row of white keys and 2-7 represents the corresponding black keys.

Play around with some of the features!
